# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is a web-based sorting visualizer that allows you to interactively visualize various sorting algorithms in action. You can see how different algorithms operate on a set of bars with heights representing numerical values.

## Features

- Randomize Array: Randomly shuffles the bars and their corresponding values.
- Insertion Sort: Visualize the insertion sort algorithm.
- Selection Sort: Visualize the selection sort algorithm.
- Bubble Sort: Visualize the bubble sort algorithm.
- Quick Sort: Visualize the quick sort algorithm.
- Merge Sort: Visualize the merge sort algorithm.
- Shell Sort: Visualize the shell sort algorithm.
- Change Size: Adjust the size of the array, and see the bars shrink or expand accordingly.
